# CardSorter
Just a card Sorter to sort all my MTG cards<br/>
Inspired by [Card-Feeder-for-a-Trading-Card-Machine](https://www.instructables.com/id/Card-Feeder-for-a-Trading-Card-Machine/ "Card-Feeder-for-a-Trading-Card-Machine") and [Card-Sorter-for-a-Trading-Card-Machine link](https://www.instructables.com/id/Card-Sorter-for-a-Trading-Card-Machine/ "Card-Sorter-for-a-Trading-Card-Machine")<br/>
Few years ago, I try by myself to build this item but my system damage cards. theguymasamato find the solution : rubber bands.<br/>
So I restart my project<br/>
